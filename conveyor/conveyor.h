/*
* Conveyor class serves as a transport buffer between the main loop and
* interrupts of a microcontroller program. Containers are created in 
* compile time, 2^SIZE_LOG2 - 1 of them.
* 
* Conveyor operations are interrupt safe, if interrupts are single level and
* mutually exclusive.
* 
* T: the value type the conveyor carries, it is accessed through Handle<T>
* SIZE_LOG2: number of buffer slots, given as a power of 2
* 
* 
* Usage: the information producer uses fetch() to obtain a buffer handle. If the
* handle is valid, it can be written, then put on the conveyor by calling
* enqueue(handle). The information consumer uses dequeue() to obtain a filled
* buffer. If the received handle is valid, the data can be read. After a handles
* contents are consumed, it should be returned by calling recycle(handle), so it
* can be reused.
